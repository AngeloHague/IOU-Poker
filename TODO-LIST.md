# To-Do List
## High Priority

1. ~~Implement Raise & all-in functions on client side~~
2. ~~Make client communicate information about the game to the player (i.e. whose turn, what players do, who wins, etc.)~~
3. ~~Connect Server with Firebase to track debts after game is complete~~
4. ~~Create Debts Screen~~
5. ~~Integrate phone exclusive features (e.g. vibration)~~
6. ~~Fix Player Cards not re-rendering upon Players leaving lobbies~~
7. ~~Add turn timers (important as this will cause the game to start skipping forfeit players)~~
## Low Priority
8. ~~Add list of available hands help screen~~
9. ~~In-game Chat~~
10. Potentially add Friend System, though optional due to Room Code system
